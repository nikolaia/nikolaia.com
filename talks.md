## Lord of Chaos - Becoming a Chaos Engineer

Our software systems are becoming more complex and more distributed. How do we have confidence in the resilience and redundancy of the systems we put in production? Chaos Engineering is the practice of introducing failures into your system in controlled experiments to learn how your system reacts. In this talk we will look into how to establish the steady state behavior of a system and how to start experimenting to discover if the system can handle spikes in traffic, failures and timeouts.

## The Docker Toolbox

Docker itself is easy to use, but when you start running several containers linked together you discover the need for easier orchestration. This talk is an introduction to Docker Swarm, Docker Machine and Docker Compose. We will look into deploying an infrastructure consisting of several linked containers (app, database and load-balancing), dispersed on several hosts, and how to achieve Blue-Green deployments.

The talk was held for the Norwegian .NET User Group in Oslo.

## Introducing DevOps mentality at a government agency

Changes in attitude and mentality has drastically changed how the Norwegian Directorate for Education and Training develop, deliver and maintain their applications. Legacy systems are now deployed at the push of a button, and new systems are delivered continuously from day one. I’ll tell you how we introduced continuous delivery and DevOps mentality, and how you can start to do the same.

The lightning talk was held at Boosterconf Bergen 2016.

## Prøveadministrasjonssystemet PAS: A DevOps story

WebForms, WCF/SOAP, Caching i session-objekter, Microsoft Reporting Services og like mye businesslogikk i Stored Procedures som i C#. Velkommen til en buzzword-bonanza fra 2007.  Vi har arvet en løsning på tre millioner kodelinjer fordelt på over 12.000 filer. Utrulling var to ganger i året, med påfølgende kodefrys. Bygging skjedde på egen maskin og utrullingsrutinene var kopiering inn i produksjon via Remote Desktop. Selvfølgelig hoppet man over QA.

Dette er en historie om enorm risikoredusering ved hjelp av DevOps og kontinuerlige leveranser, og et foredrag som fokuserer på å se løsninger fremfor problemer.

The talk is in Norwegian and was held internally at BEKK
